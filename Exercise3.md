#Practice with Markdown Files:
#by Jonathan Stewart

This is a practice document that contains:
1. Two types of headers
2. A list
3. A link
4. Code

I used the following [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for help on using markdown. 
I have used jupyter notebooks before, so I have some familiarity with it. I find it fairly **intuitive** so far.

```
if basicmarkdownworks == True:
	Var = 1
	else:
	Var = 0
```
